            <h2>New Remote Control Pilot Recommendations</h2>

            <p><em>A Note about the AMA Park Flyer Program</em> : Please be sure to read and understand the <a href="https://www.modelaircraft.org/parkflyer/pp-faq.aspx">AMA Frequently Asked Questions about the Park Pilot Program</a>.</p>

            <p>The Fairmont Flyers allows park pilots to be members of the club, however you are limited to aircraft that are less than 2 pounds AND fly slower than 60 MPH. For the safety of our members and the land owners this rule will be enforced. In most cases, the benefits that come with the Full AMA membership out weight the cost savings of the park pilot program.</p>

            <p>Come join us at our informal fly-in picnics at Noon on the second Saturday of each month, May-August. (the third Saturday is a rain date) &#8211; Get down to the field, have a hot dog on us and fly a plane or hang out.</p>

            <h3>New Pilot Rules</h3>

            <p>All new pilots, regardless of experience level, are required to perform a landing from both the left and the right (wind permitting) before being allowed to fly unsupervised. These landings must be performed with 2 club offers or safety officers. The officers expect you to perform a good preflight of your airplane, and will not allow the plane to fly if they see anything that they deem to be a safety issue. Please see our <a href="#documents"  class="local_link" data-link="documents" >field rules</a> and bi-laws for more information.</p>

            <p>We want everyone to have fun, but we also want to provide a safe environment for pilots and their families to enjoy the hobby.</p>

            <p>If you have never flow before, haven&#8217;t flowing in a long time, or have doubts  or questions about a new airplane  please consider taking advantage of our new pilot training program.</p>

            <h3>New Pilot Training Program</h3>

            <p>Our new pilot training program is available to all card-carrying club members. Our instructors are volunteering their time so that you can become a better pilot more quickly than if you were learning on your own. We use a method known as &#8220;buddy boxing&#8221; to teach new pilots. This allows the instructor to hold a second radio and take over control of the airplane if it appears that the airplane is out of control and may crash.</p>

            <p>Please keep in mind that club instructors and the Fairmont Flyers cannot guarantee that your equipment will not become damaged during lessons, and we are not responsible for any needed repairs (Though, if you ask nicely you will likely find more than enough people willing to help you repair your airplane). We will provide our best effort to keep your airplane safe, but it is not always possible. This is especially true while you are learning to land and take off and the airplane is in close proximity to the ground.</p>

            <p>For scheduling, please contact our volunteer instructors (information located on the <a href="#contactus"  class="local_link" data-link="contactus" >Contact Us</a> page). You may need to contact more than 1 to setup a time that works best for you.</p>

            <h3>New Pilot Equipment Guide</h3>

            <p>One of the most daunting aspects of getting into Remote Control Flying is purchasing your first airplane and all the equipment that goes along with it. Below are 2 different recommendations of airplanes for new pilots. The first option is a much simplier option for people that would like to jump in feet first and begin flying in as little time as possible. The second option is a little more complex and will require you to learn more as you setup and fine-tune your airplane. Which option you choose will be completely up to you.</p>

            <p>The two options below are for those who do not know where to start.  If you already have an airplane or would like a different setup, we will try to support you the best we can.</p>

            <h3>Option 1: Ready to Fly Electric Trainer</h3>

            <p>Airplane/Radio Combintion :</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/airplanes/staff-picks/trainer/apprentice-s-15e-rtf-with-safe-reg%3B-technology-efl3100">Apprentice S 15e RTF </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/airplanes/20-off-hobbyzone-item-over-149/trainer/f4u-corsair-s-rtf-with-safe-reg%3B-technology-hbz8200">F4U Corsair S RTF with SAFE</a>
                </li>
            </ul>



            <p>It is recommended that you purchase several additional batteries so that you can get more flying time in.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.horizonhobby.com/3200mah-3s-111v-20c-lipo--13awg-ec3-eflb32003s">Extra Batteries</a></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Option 2: Almost Ready To Fly Electric Trainer</h3>
            <p>With the growing number of Ready to Fly systems on the market, we no longer recommend an Almost Ready To Fly trainer. Most new RC pilots will have a better experience, for less money, with a Ready to fly system like the ones listed above.</p>

            <h3>Flight Simulators</h3>
            <p>RC Flight Simulators are useful tools for learning how to fly remote control airplanes. They do NOT replace buddy boxing with an experienced instructor on a real remote control airplane, but using a flight simulator on a regular basis during your training will help you advance your skills faster.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.aeroflyfs.com/">Aerofly</a> (Mac and Windows)</li>
                <li><a href="http://modelsimulator.com/">FMS</a> (Free, Windows Only)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.phoenix-sim.com/">Phoenix</a>  (Windows Only)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.realflight.com/">Real Flight</a> (Windows Only)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Radio/Joysticks are available for FMS from third part vendors. AeroFly, Phoenix, and Real Flight and all be purchases with or without a Radio/Joy Stick. AeroFly and Phoenix have adaptors for using your Real radio with them. Adaptors and software are available to use your real radio with FMS as well.</p>

            <p>Due to the large number of hardware and software options the Fairmont Flyers cannot provide support for your RC Flight Simulator.</p>

            <h3>Membership Renewal</h3>

            <p>You can renew your membership using Paypal, but will need to have a Paypal account, and follow the steps below. The money must be sent as <strong>For friends and Family</strong>. If you cannot use this method please bring dues payment to the next club meeting.</p>

            <p>Please email your mailing address to paypal@fairmontflyers.org if you would like us to send your membership card to you in the mail, otherwise you can pickup your card at the yearly dues meeting.</p>

            <p>Please remember that club dues are required by April 1 of each year. Late fees will be assessed after that, and required to be paid before you receive your membership card.</p>
